          A Random Essay about Life..
      </center>
  </h1>
   In life we come across a lot of challenges.Some of them make us who we are while some tell us what we should be. And some other times 
   it is the opposite.<br> There will be <b>struggles</b>,there will be <b>bad days</b>.Days which would never seem to end.Days which would go 
   on and on,which would keep hurting us till we can't<br> go on.Many of us tend to give up on days but the people who persevere get to enjoy 
   the brighter side of the days.The night is  darkest before dawn but we<br> shouldnt forget the rainbow at the other end of the rainy day.
   Thus the holy book says <i>" If Difficulty may come in the night, certainly relief comes in the Morning.</i><br  >

   We understand to <b>love</b>,to <b>give</b>,to <b>find pleasure</b> but what we do not understand is <b>ourselves</b> during all of these.Life 
   can lie to us and noone will stop it,it can<br /> play all manner of games with us even realising because there's noone controlling it.But whatever 
   happens, happens for the better.Good of all in it.Whatever decisions<br /> life takes for us is already planned by it and we must learn to come to
   terms with them. Because <b>Change</b> they say <i>is the only thing that isnt constant.</i> We should learn<br /> to accept whatever situation
   we find ourselves in and therefore<em>hope for the best..</em><br />
   <hr width="300" /><br />

   We should learn the fact that no matter how hard we try to fit in this imperfect world. It'll never acknowledge us for who we truly are.
   We always feel like becoming<br /> everything around us.But what we do not realize is that everyone to be happy at the end of the day
   .They just want to find someone who will love them and stand <br />by them throughout. Through the <b>stormy nights</b>, through the <b>lonely days</b>
   and through the <b>cold memories.</b>

   <i>Because deep down we all need someone to listen to us and love us....</i> <br /><br />
